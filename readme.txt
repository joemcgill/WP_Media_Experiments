A WordPress plugin for testing experimental media functionality.

== Description ==

This is a plugin for testing out experimental media functionality that may eventually be considered for inclusion in WordPress Core. Inspiration for getting this started was Morten Rand-Hendriksen's (@mor10) [tweet about adding native lazy loading](https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1114987837370261504) to WordPress.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =

- Scaffolds the plugin
- Adds initial functionality for filtering core image and gallery blocks
- Adds 'loading="lazy"' attributes to image, gallery, and media-text blocks
- Adds lazy loading to any image that is dynamically generated by `wp_get_attachment_image()`.
